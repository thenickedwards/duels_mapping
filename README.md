# duels_mapping

A data environment designed to extract statistics and rate MLS players based on aerial dules won/lost, tackles won, interceptions, and recoveries

## Duels Map

On many pen-tapping occasions, Coach Schmetzer will note in interviews one of his preferred metrics to evaluate the performance of a player and the team is duels. In an effort to create a `Schmetzer Score` rating, I have combined aerial dules won as well as aerial dueles lost, tackles won, interceptions, and recoveries into a custom algorithm to measure this contirbution per player, by team, and across the league.

| Stat              | Point Value | Description   |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| aerial duels won  | 1           | duels won     |
| aerial duels lost | -0.75       | duels lost    |
| tackles won       | 1           | tackles won   |
| interceptions     | .75         | interceptions |
| recoveries        | .5          | recoveries    |
