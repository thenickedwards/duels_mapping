# duels_mapping

Welcome to duels*mapping, a code repository which supports a new composite sports statistic: **`Contested Possession Metric`**. A method for rating a player's ability to win aerial duels and tackles as well as force interceptions and secure recoveries--which effectively tells us about a player's ability to win and keep possession. Since `Contested Possession Metric` is a bit of a mouthful, we've dubbed it the `Schmetzer Score`. As a Sounders supporter, I've watched many press conferences where Coach Schmetzer will tap his pen on the table and reference his preferred statistic: \_duels won*. In an effort to create a fuller picture, I have combined aerial duels won as well as aerial duels lost, tackles won, interceptions, and recoveries into a custom algorithm to measure this skill by player, team, and across the league.

Currently the source data set is from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/). These [amazing folks](https://www.sports-reference.com/about.html) are doing God's work, making sports data publicly available.

## Duels Map AKA The Schmetzer Score

On many pen-tapping occasions, Coach Schmetzer will note in interviews one of his preferred metrics to evaluate the performance of a player and the team is duels. In an effort to create a `Schmetzer Score` rating, I have combined aerial dules won as well as aerial dueles lost, tackles won, interceptions, and recoveries into a custom algorithm to measure this contirbution per player, by team, and across the league.

<!-- ??? should this be a dim table? -->
